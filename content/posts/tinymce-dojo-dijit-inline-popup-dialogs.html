<p>Following on from my <a href="http://blog.badsyntax.co/post/2365205144/tinymce-jquery-ui-inline-popups">original post</a> on how to create a custom TinyMCE inline popups plugin (using jQuery UI), I have now created the Dojo Dijit version.</p>
<p>This plugin is directed at those who are already using Dijit as their UI library, and is intended to bring consistency to the interface. I have decided not to code the custom alert and confirm dialogs (as is with the original TinyMCE inline popups plugin), as I don&#8217;t see a real need to replace these default native system dialogs.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/badsyntax/tinymce-custom-inlinepopups/tree/master/dojoinlinepopups">project on github</a>, or take a look at <a href="http://demos.badsyntax.co/tinymce-dojo-popups/">the demo</a>.</p>
<p>Installation is straightforward:</p>
<ol><li>Ensure you have loaded the dojo library and theme</li>
<li>Ensure you have loaded the dialog dijit</li>
<li>Copy the &#8216;dojoinlinepopups&#8217; folder into the tinymce plugins directory</li>
<li>Disable the &#8216;inlinepopups&#8217; plugin, and enable the &#8216;dojoinlinepopups&#8217; plugin when initiating tinymce. </li>
<li>That is all! If you get stuck, refer to the demo!</li>
