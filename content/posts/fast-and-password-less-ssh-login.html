<p>When doing development on the cmd line, it&#8217;s useful to set up certain shortcuts for certain actions to make development quicker. One of more useful shortcuts is to allow you log in to a remote machine without typing a password every time. This is incredibly handy and can save a lot of time. Combined with an alias for SSH, and a shortened hostname, the final command can be something like <code>`s b`</code> (which equates to: ssh into host &#8216;b&#8217;).</p>
<p>To achieve this we&#8217;ll need to</p>
<ol><li>copy our public key across to the remote server;</li>
<li>set up an alias for ssh;</li>
<li>edit our hosts file and add a shortened version of the remote machine host name.</li>
</ol><h3>Create and copy our SSH public key to remote machine</h3>
<p>Enter this command in terminal, replacing the placeholder info with real-world info:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint shell">ssh-keygen -t rsa -C EMAIL; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -l REMOTE_USERNAME REMOTE_HOST 'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
</pre>
<h3>Create the SSH alias</h3>
<p>You want add the alias into either ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_aliases. If you are unsure, then use ~/.bashrc:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint shell">alias s='/usr/bin/ssh -l REMOTE_USERNAME'</pre>
<p>Type the following to create a new BASH session:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint shell">exec bash</pre>
<h3>Edit hosts file</h3>
<p>Open up /etc/hosts in your favourite text editor, and add a line similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">1.11.11.11 b</pre>
<p>The first part is obviously the IP address of your remote machine, and the second part is the hostname.</p>
<p>And that should be all you need to do to be able to type <code>`s b`</code> which will log you into your remote machine without any additional tasks to perform.</p>
