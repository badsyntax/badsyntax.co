<p>
  I&rsquo;m a fan of code formatting tools, and of Sublime Text. I wanted to find a plugin that 
  could &lsquo;beautify&rsquo; my Sass files from within the text editor. After a bit of googling around, 
  I could not find such a plugin, so I decided to create one myself.

<p>
  Introducing SassBeautify - A Sublime Text 2 plugin that beautifies Sass files:

</p>
<p>
  It&rsquo;s a pretty basic plugin, and is essentially a wrapper around the &lsquo;sass-convert&rsquo; utility. 
  It&rsquo;s also my first bit of python code. Although I never coded in python before, I found the concepts and syntax familiar. 
  The hardest part was getting familiar with the Sublime Text API, but I learned a lot from looking at the code within 
  the &lsquo;Default&rsquo; package.

<p>
  If you would like to use the plugin, you can install it from the 
  <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">sublime text package manager</a>, and it should would on GNU/Linux; 
  Windows and OSX. (Read the <a href="https://github.com/badsyntax/SassBeautify/blob/master/README.md">README</a>&nbsp;for more 
  detailed installation instructions.) If you find it doesn&rsquo;t work as you expect, or you would like to make some suggestions, 
  please create a ticket in the <a href="https://github.com/badsyntax/SassBeautify/issues">issue tracker</a>.
