<p>Here's a quick tip for installing client side dependencies (required by your test scipts) using bower on TravisCI.</p>
<p>You basically need to tell TravisCI to install bower (using npm) as a globl executable, and then install your dependencies.</p>
<p>Here's an example .travis.yml file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "0.10"
before_script:
  - npm install -g bower
  - bower install
</pre>
