<p>This is a straightforward no BS introduction to getting started with the Vim Nerd Tree plugin.</p> <p>The installation is actually really simple.</p> <ol><li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">Download</a> and unzip the plugin into your ~/.vim directory</li> <li>Open Vim</li> <li>type :NERDTree or :NERDTreeToggle</li> </ol><p>I&#8217;m undecided if I&#8217;ll find this plugin useful as up till now I&#8217;ve gotten used to navigating directories on the command line. My &#8216;c&#8217; and &#8216;d&#8217; keyboard keys are the most worn out :) But I&#8217;m all for better productivity, so I&#8217;m gonna give it a bash.</p>
