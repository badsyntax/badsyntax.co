I was tasked with building a simple radial progress chart widget. I decided to use canvas as it seem the best 
tech for the job. (I needed to show 100 different states of this chart, so creating 100 different images just was not 
the best approach.)
</p>
<p>
Now &lt;canvas&gt; is not supported in IE8, but you can use the excellent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/">excanvas</a> (Explorer Canvas) script to allow you to use the 
HTML5 spec for canvas in IE8. This is awesome! Although the script is pretty old now and hasn't been updated in years, it still does the job pretty well.
</p>
<p>
The specific chart I was builing was hidden behind other elements on the page, and required a user interaction to view it, thus I did not want to load the 
excanvas script on every page, I wanted to lazyload the script when it was required. This turned out to be quite difficult, as the script relies on the 
<code>document.onreadystatechange</code> event to initialize - which essentially means you cannot lazyload the excanvas script!
</p>
<p>
I could not believe no-one else was having the same problem as I. Google search was only bringing back one <a href="http://pipwerks.com/2009/03/12/lazy-loading-excanvasjs/">relevant post</a> on 
on how to hack the source to get this to work. Bah!
</p>
<p>Here's the solution I eventually settled with - no need to hack the source:</p>
<p>You simply need to call <code>G_vmlCanvasManager.init_(document);</code> after lazyloading in the excanvas script:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
function init() {

    var canvas = $('&lt;canvas /&gt;').prop({
        width: 100,
        height: 100
    }).get(0);

    element.append(canvas);

    if (typeof G_vmlCanvasManager !== "undefined") {
        G_vmlCanvasManager.init_(document);  // bam!
        G_vmlCanvasManager.initElement(canvas);
    }

    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // etc
}

if (!document.createElement('canvas').getContext) {
    $.getScript('/lib/excanvas.min.js', init);
} else {
    init();
}
</pre>
<p>Well hopefully this can save you the time I wasted!</p>
