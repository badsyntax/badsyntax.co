<p>Coding has always been something Iâ€™ve enjoyed doing from a young age, and have always been a big fan of GNU/Linux and OSS.</p>
<p>I work as a User Interface Developer for <a href="http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/">digital media agency</a> in London, and I aspire to be a great Javascript developer.</p>
I'm currently in the process of setting up a small hosting company with a friend, called 
<a href="http://redhammerdigital.com/">red hammer digital</a>. I 
I have fair bit of experience with Linux sys admin and currently manage and operate the dedicated servers which we use to provide 
robust hosting solutions to our clients.</p>

<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>This site was coded using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">expressjs</a> framework. There's lots I can do to improve it, but I wanted to keep it realy simple to begin with. I'm currently not using a database to store and retrieve the site content, I'm using static content files and wrote my own very simple
datastore to access the content. Eventually, I will move the content into a DB, and will probably use MongoDB.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a look at the source code, which I'm hosting at github. You can access the repository here: <a href="https://github.com/badsyntax/badsyntax.co">https://github.com/badsyntax/badsyntax.co</a></p>
