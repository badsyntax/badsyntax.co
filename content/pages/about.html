  Coding has always been something Iâ€™ve enjoyed doing from a young age. I have always been a big fan of GNU/Linux and OSS, and try to contribute to open-source projects wherever possible. (Check out my <a href="http://github.com/badsyntax">github profile</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  I aspire to be a good "full-stack" developer and have an interest in all things web. I have a decent amount of experience of working with server-side technologies like PHP and BASH, I'm familiar with database system like MySQL and PostgreSQL and
  am pretty comfortable working on the command line. For the past couple of years I always worked remotely on my dev server over SSH, 
  using VIM as my text editor, but recently I've just purchased an awesome ultrabook and have decided to work locally instead, 
  running Ubuntu Desktop.
</p>
<p>
  I have a lot of experience working with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Recently I've really been
  enjoying Javascript and I guess that's what interests me the most at this time. I recently got into developing on the node.js platform and am loving it!
</p>
<p>Currently I work as a User Interface <span>Developer</span> for <a href="http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk/">digital media agency</a> in London, and I'm currently in the process of setting up a small hosting company with a friend, called 
<a href="http://redhammerdigital.com/">red hammer digital</a>. I manage and operate the dedicated servers which we use to provide 
robust hosting solutions to our clients.</p>
<p>Have a look at my <a href="/blog">blog</a> to view more about what interests me.</p>
