  Hello, welcome to my website. After all these years, after all the code I've written for other people, 
  I finally decided to put some effort in and get <em>my own site</em> up and running!
</p>
<p>
  I built this site using Javascript on the node.js platform. It's been a real pleasure to work with 
  Javascript on the server side. You can read a bit more about how I built this site on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.
