  Hello, welcome to my website. This is a little area of the internet where I get to show off a bit and write about things that
  interest me.

  I built this site using Javascript on the node.js platform. It's been a real pleasure to work with 
  Javascript on the server side. You can read a bit more about how I built this site on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.
